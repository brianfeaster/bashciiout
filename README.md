# bashciiout - A Breakout game for the terminal/console written in Bash


## How to play

- There are two games current:
  - brickout
  - tennibash
- Run the game of choice in your shell.  IE: `./brickout` or `./tennibash`
  - Some versions of Bash are buggy (old Macbook Pros / Bash 3.2) If so pass the scripts argument `1` IE: `./brickout 1`
- Player 2 can play by running the script as well.  Must be on the same machine/filesystem.
- Move left 'h' or right 'l'
- Quit/Exit 'q'
